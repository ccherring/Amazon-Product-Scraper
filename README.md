# Amazon Product Scraper
Scrape and store multiple pages of Amazon product data for a particular brand. This script scrapes product name, price, and rating for Brawny products, storing the results in a csv. I am using a Python 3 Jupyter Notebook. Required packages can be loaded in the Anaconda Prompt using `conda install`. Below are a few additional commands you will need to run in the Anaconda Prompt to ensure all packages are loaded correctly. 
```
pip install fake-useragent --upgrade
```
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
```
conda install -c anaconda beautifulsoup4
```
