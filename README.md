# Amazon Product Scraper
Scrape and store multiple pages of Amazon product data for a particular brand. This script scrapes product name, price, and rating for Brawny products, storing the results in a csv. Below are the packages you will need to install from the command prompt (I use Anaconda Prompt) prior to running. 
```
pip install fake-useragent --upgrade
```
